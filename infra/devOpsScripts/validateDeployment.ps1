#Requires -Version 7.0

<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Examines the web app that was deployed to identify any known issues and provide recommendations.

  <This command should only be run after using the azd command to deploy resources to Azure>
.DESCRIPTION
  Use this command to examine your deployed settings and automatically find recommendations
  that can help you troubleshoot issues that you may encounter.

  This script was created after identifying intermittent Azure deployment issues. Many
  of which can be resolved by re-running 'azd provision' command.

  NOTE: This script is used by our QA process to ensure the quality of this sample it measures
  characteristics of the deployment and will be modified as needed to explore intermittent issues

  This engineering code may be repurposed for your scenario as desired
  but is not covered by the guidance in this content.
  
  This functionality assumes that the web app, app configuration service, and app
  service have already been successfully deployed.

.PARAMETER ResourceGroupName
  A required parameter for the name of resource group that contains the environment that was
  created by the azd command. The cmdlet will populate the App Config Svc and Key
  Vault services in this resource group with Azure AD app registration config data.

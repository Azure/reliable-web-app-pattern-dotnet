# Starting your modernization journey

In this guide we provided the content to build a web app based on other resources such as the Azure Architecture Center. In this section we'll highlight those source materials that you can use to learn more about Azure and modernization.

## Additional sources for Azure Best Practices

Use the following resources to learn more about Microsoft's best practices and recommendations for building solutions on Azure.

For further guidance on how to build Azure solutions that align with Microsoft's best practices and recommendations

- [Cloud Adoption Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/overview) - Helps an organization prepare and execute their strategy to build solutions on Azure.
- [Azure Architecture Center fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/) - Provides a library of content that presents a structured approach for designing applications on Azure that are scalable, secure, resilient, and highly available.
- [Well Architected Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/) - Describes the best practices and design principles that should be applied when designing Azure solutions that align with Microsoft's recommended best practices.
- [Azure Architectures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/browse/) - Provides architecture diagrams and technology descriptions for reference architectures, real world examples of cloud architectures, and solution ideas for common workloads on Azure.

## Additional sources for Azure Migration

The following tools and resources can help you with migrating on-prem resources to Azure.

- [Azure Migrate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/migrate-services-overview) - Azure Migrate provides a simplified migration, modernization, and optimization service for Azure that handles assessment, migration of web apps, SQL server, and Virtual Machines.

## Additional sources for upgrading .NET Framework apps

This solution includes a dotnet web app capable of running on Linux that was deployed to an App Service running Windows.
The Azure App Service windows platform enables customers to move .NET Framework web apps to Azure without upgrading to newer framework versions.
For customers wanting Linux App Service plans, or new features and performance improvements added to the latest versions of dotnet, we recommend the following resources.

- [Overview of porting from .NET Framework to .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/) - A starting point for finding additional guidance based on your specific type of .NET app.
- [Overview of the .NET Upgrade Assistant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview) - A console tool that can help automate many of the tasks associated with upgrading .NET framework projects.
- [Migrating from ASP.NET to ASP.NET Core in Visual Studio](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-project-migrations-visual-studio-extension/) - The ASP.NET Core team is developing a Visual Studio extension that can assist with incremental migrations of web apps.

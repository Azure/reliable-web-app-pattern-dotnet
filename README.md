# Reliable web app pattern for .NET

The reference implementation provides a production-grade web application that uses best practices from our guidance and gives developers concrete examples to build their own Reliable Web Application in Azure. It simulates the journey from an on-premises ASP.NET application to a migration to Azure. It shows you what changes to make to maximize the benefits of the cloud in the initial cloud adoption phase. Here's an outline of the contents in this readme:

## Azure Architecture Center guidance

This project has a [companion article in the Azure Architecture Center](https://aka.ms/eap/rwa/dotnet/doc) that describes design patterns and best practices for migrating to the cloud. We suggest you read it as it will give important context to the considerations applied in this implementation.

## Videos

This project has a six-part video series that details the reliable web app pattern for .NET web app. For more information, see [Reliable web app pattern videos (YouTube)](https://aka.ms/eap/rwa/dotnet/videos).

## Workflow

- Azure Front Door routes traffic based on availability of the primary region. When the primary region is unavailable it will route traffic to the secondary region.
- When Front Door passes the request to the Web App, it will pass-through the Azure Web Application Firewall. The Azure Web Application Firewall will evaluate the request and protect the web app against common security attacks.
- Once the traffic reaches the web front-end users will be shown the home page. They can view these pages without authenticating.
- Navigating to the Concerts on the web app will send a request to the web front-end that tells it to ask the web api app for details about upcoming concerts.
- Details about the upcoming concerts will be retrieved from the Azure SQL Database by the web api app with a SQL query. The results will be formatted as a JSON response and returned to the web front-end.
- When the web front-end receives results from the API it will use razor template engine to render the HTML page shown to the user that asked for a list of concerts.
- Once a user adds a concert ticket to their shopping cart the front-end web app will start interacting with Azure Cache for Redis. Asking the web app to put a concert ticket into the cart tells the web app to save information about that pending purchase as JSON data in Redis as part of a session object for the current user. Saving the session to an external datastore enables the web app to load balance traffic more evenly and to handle horizontal scaling events without losing the customer's intent to buy a ticket. No inventory management is included in this sample so there are no quantities deducted, or placed on reserve, in the backend of the system.
- As the user checks out the front-end web app will ask the user to authenticate with Azure AD. This scenario is for a call center that places orders on-behalf of customers so the accounts in-use are managed by Relecloud and are not self-managed.
- After authenticating to Azure AD the front-end web app will receive a token from Azure AD that represents the current user. This token is saved as a cookie in the user's browser and is not persisted by the front-end web app.
- As the user proceeds with checkout the web app will collect payment data. Payment data is not sent anywhere for this sample.
- When the payment data is submitted for approval the ticket will be purchased. Logic to handle this is located in the web api project so the web app makes a call to the web api project.
- Prior to calling the API, the front-end web app asks the MSAL library for a token it can use to call the web api app as an authenticated user.
- When the MSAL library, in the front-end web app,  has a token it will cache it in Azure Cache for Redis. If it does not have a token it will request one from Azure AD and then save it in Azure Cache for Redis.
- Once the ticket purchase request is sent to the web api app the API will render the ticket image and save it to Azure storage.
- After the ticket purchase is completed successfully the user will be directed to their tickets page where they can see a list of the tickets they have purchased. These tickets will be immediately available because rendering the ticket was part of the purchase request.
  - As information flows between services the Azure network handles traffic routing across private endpoints by using Azure Private DNS to lookup the correct IP addresses. This enables the system to block public network traffic and use a single v-net to manage traffic between these systems. This v-net can be connected to others as-needed to allow the app to call other systems in your digital estate or to allow other systems to call the web API so they can access details about ticket purchases.
  - As the front-end, and web api, apps process requests they are sending data to Application Insights so that you can monitor information about processing web requests
  - When the web app is started for the first time it will load configuration data from App Config Service and Azure Key Vault. This information is saved in the web apps memory and is not accessed afterwards.

## Steps to deploy the reference implementation

This reference implementation provides you with the instructions and templates you need to deploy this solution. This solution uses the Azure Dev CLI to set up Azure services
and deploy the code.

### Pre-requisites

1. To run the scripts, Windows users require [Powershell 7.2 (LTS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows) or above. Alternatively, you can use a bash terminal using [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). macOS users can use a bash terminal.

1. [Install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
    Run the following command to verify that you're running version
    2.38.0 or higher.

    ```ps1
    az version
    ```
    
    After the installation, run the following command to [sign in to Azure interactively](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli#sign-in-interactively).

    ```ps1
    az login
    ```
1. [Upgrade the Azure CLI Bicep extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install#azure-cli).
    Run the following command to verify that you're running version 0.12.40 or higher.

    ```ps1
    az bicep version
    ```

1. [Install the Azure Dev CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd).
    Run the following command to verify that the Azure Dev CLI is installed.

    ```ps1
    azd version
    ```

1. [Install .NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
    Run the following command to verify that the .NET SDK 6.0 is installed.
    ```ps1
    dotnet --version
    ```

### Get the code

Please clone the repo to get started.

```
git clone https://github.com/Azure/reliable-web-app-pattern-dotnet
```

And switch to the folder so that `azd` will recognize the solution.

```
cd reliable-web-app-pattern-dotnet
```

### Deploying to Azure

Relecloud's developers use the `azd` command line experience to deploy the code. This means their local workflow is the same
experience that runs from the GitHub action. You can use these
steps to follow their experience by running the commands from the folder where this guide is stored after cloning this repo.

Use this command to get started with deployment by creating an
`azd` environment on your workstation.

<table>
<tr>
<td>PowerShell</td>
<td>

```ps1
$myEnvironmentName="relecloudresources"
```

```ps1
azd init -e $myEnvironmentName
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bash</td>
<td>

```bash
myEnvironmentName="relecloudresources"
```

```bash
azd init -e $myEnvironmentName
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

When prompted, select the preferred Azure Subscription and the Location:

![screenshot azd env new](./assets/Guide/Azd-Env-New.png)

#### (Optional Steps) Choose Prod or Non-prod environment

The Relecloud team uses the same bicep templates to deploy
their production, and non-prod, environments. To do this
they set `azd` environment parameters that change the behavior
of the next steps.

> If you skip the next two optional steps, and change nothing,
> then the bicep templates will default to non-prod settings.

*Step: 1*

Relecloud devs deploy the production environment by running the
following command to choose the SKUs they want in production.

```ps1
azd env set IS_PROD true
```

*Step: 2*

Relecloud devs also use the following command to choose a second
Azure location because the production environment is
multiregional.

```ps1
azd env set SECONDARY_AZURE_LOCATION westus3
```

> You can find a list of available Azure regions by running
> the following Azure CLI command.
> 
> ```ps1
> az account list-locations --query "[].name" -o tsv
> ```

#### Provision the infrastructure

Relecloud uses the following command to deploy the Azure
services defined in the bicep files by running the provision
command.

> This step will take several minutes based on the region
> and deployment options you selected.

```ps1
azd provision
```

> When the command finishes you have deployed Azure App
> Service, SQL Database, and supporting services to your
> subscription. If you log into the the
> [Azure Portal](http://portal.azure.com) you can find them
> in the resource group named `$myEnvironmentName-rg`.

#### Create App Registrations

Relecloud devs have automated the process of creating Azure
AD resources that support the authentication features of the
web app. They use the following command to create two new
App Registrations within Azure AD. The command is also
responsible for saving configuration data to Key Vault and
App Configuration so that the web app can read this data.

<table>
<tr>
<td>PowerShell</td>
<td>

```ps1
.\infra\createAppRegistrations.ps1 -g "$myEnvironmentName-rg"
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bash</td>
<td>

```bash
chmod +x ./infra/createAppRegistrations.sh
./infra/createAppRegistrations.sh -g "$myEnvironmentName-rg"
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Deploy the code

To finish the deployment process the Relecloud devs run the
folowing `azd` commands to build, package, and deploy the dotnet
code for the front-end and API web apps.

```ps1
 azd env set AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP "$myEnvironmentName-rg"
```

```ps1
 azd deploy
```

When finished the console will display the URI for the web app. You can use this URI to view the deployed solution in a browser.

![screenshot of Relecloud app home page](./assets/Guide/WebAppHomePage.png)

> If you face any issues with the deployment, see the [Known issues document](known-issues.md) below for possible workarounds. There could be interim issues while deploying to Azure, and repeating the steps after a few minutes should fix most of them. Azure deployments are incremental by default, and only failed actions will be retired.

#### Clean up Azure Resources

1. Unprovision the Azure Resources
2. Clean up App Registrations
3. Delete the Deployment

##### 1. Unprovision the Azure Resources
To tear down an enviroment, and clean up the Azure resource group, use the folloing command:

```ps1
azd down --force --purge --no-prompt
```

> You can also use the Azure Portal to delete the "relecloudresources" resource groups. This approach will not purge the Key Vault or App Configuration services and they will remain in your subscription for 7 days in a deleted state that does not charge your subscription. This feature enables you to recover the data if the configuration was accidentally deleted.

##### 2. Clean up App Registrations
You will also need to delete the two Azure AD app registrations that were created. You can find them in Azure AD by searching for their environment name. 
 
 **Delete App Registrations** 

 ![screenshot of Azure AD App Registrations](./assets/Guide/AD-AppRegistrations.png)
 
 You will also need to purge the App Configuration Service instance that was deployed.

 **Purge App Configurations**

 ![screenshot of Purging App Configurations](./assets/Guide/AppConfig-Purge.png)

##### 3. Delete the Deployment

Your Azure subscription will retain your deployment request as a stateful object.
If you would like to change the Azure region for this deployment you will need to
delete the deployment by running the following command.

```
az deployment delete --name $myEnvironmentName
```

> You can list all deployments with the following command
> `az deployment sub list --query "[].name" -o tsv`

### Local Development

Relecloud developers use Visual Studio to develop locally and they co-share
an Azure SQL database for local dev. The team chooses this workflow to
help them practice early integration of changes as modifying the
database and other shared resources can impact multiple workstreams.

To connect to the shared database the dev team uses connection strings
from Key Vault and App Configuration Service. Devs use the following
script to retrieve data and store it as
[User Secrets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=windows)
on their workstation.

Using the `secrets.json` file helps the team keep their credentials
secure. The file is stored outside of the source control directory so
the data is never accidentally checked-in. And the devs don't share
credentials over email or other ways that could compromise their
security.

Managing secrets from Key Vault and App Configuration ensures that only
authorized team members can access the data and also centralizes the
administration of these secrets so they can be easily changed.

New team members should setup their environment by following these steps.

# Reliable Web App Pattern

This repository provides resources to help developers build a Reliable web app on Azure. A Reliable Web App is a set of services, code, and infrastructure deployed in Azure that applies practices from the Well-Architected Framework. This pattern is shared with three components to help you use Azure to build a web app that follows Microsoft's recommended guidance for achieving reliability, scalability, and security in the cloud.

This repository contains the following guidance to show you how to build a reliable web app and explain the logic behind each decision:

- [Reference architecture](reliable-web-app.md) - the reference architecture illustrates the web application and explains the decisions made.
- [Implementation guidance](implementation.md) - step-by-step instructions to deploy the reference architecture.
- [Patterns](patterns.md)
- [Service level objectives and cost](slo-and-cost.md)
- [Additional resources](additional-resources.md)
- [Security](SECURITY.md)
- [Support](SUPPORT.md)
